          <h3>Interaction Design</h3>
          <p>As a studied Interaction Designer I know more than just the usual
            UI/UX Design tricks. User behaviour is not bound to the screen
            and we humans exist in a physical world. I make products
            which are part of the <strong>human</strong> experience.

          <h3>Fullstack Development</h3>
          <p>Right now I am participating in a coding bootcamp at Le Wagon.
          I was tired of not fully grasping development and wanted to become
          a <strong>wizard</strong> as many of my dear colleagues were and are.

        <h3>Design Engineer</h3>
        <p>So what happens if you combine the former two with a charming personality,
          a keen eye and sharp sense of empathy for users and co-workers?
          I am someone who stands between the lines and facilitates <strong>communication</strong>.
          Languages are my biggest asset and so could be yours.
